# YT Notes 🎥📝

YT Notes is a Chrome extension that helps you take timestamped notes directly on YouTube videos.  
Each note is linked to the exact moment in the video, so you can instantly jump back just by clicking on it.  

It also supports **exporting** and **importing** notes, making it easy to share or back them up.

- ⏱️ Click a note to instantly jump to that time in the video.

## 💡 Inspiration
I got this idea from PW (physics wallah). They use the same feature like this in their video lectures, so im used to this feature but when i watch lectures in youtube it becomes difficult for me to make tracks of topics
and question through out that whole lectures so i made this small extension which is minimal but very usefull...!!
I didn't had money to upload it on chrome webstore that's why i posted it here.
So make usefull of it,
Thanks.
